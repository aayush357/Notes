## Important features introduced after Java 8

After Java 8, several new features and improvements have been introduced in the Java language:

1. Java 9 introduced the **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**, which improves the organization of the JDK and allows for more fine-grained control over dependencies.

2. Java 10 introduced **local variable type inference,** which allows developers to use the **"var" keyword** to infer the type of a local variable based on the initializer expression.

3. Java 11 removed the Java EE and CORBA modules from the JDK and made the HTTP client, JAXB, and the JavaFX modules available as separate modules. It also introduced the ability to launch single-file source-code programs.

4. Java 12 introduced switch expressions, which allow developers to use the "switch" statement as either a statement or an expression.

5. Java 13 added text blocks, which allow developers to write multi-line string literals more easily.

6. Java 14 introduced the "record" keyword, which allows developers to create simple, immutable data classes more easily.

7. Java 15 introduced the "sealed classes" feature, which allows developers to define a restricted set of subclasses for a class or interface.

8. Java 16 introduced the "pattern matching for instanceof" feature, which allows developers to simplify their type-checking logic.
