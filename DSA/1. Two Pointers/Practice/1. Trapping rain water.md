## Problem: 
 Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

	Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
	Output: 6
	Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**

	Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
	Output: 9

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10`<sup>5</sup>

## Notes: 
- At current block level of water is determined by minimum of leftMax and rightMax

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int trap(int[] height) {

        int water = 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;

        while(left < right){

            int leftHeight = height[left];
            int rightHeight = height[right];
            
            if(leftHeight < rightHeight){
                
                if(leftHeight > leftMax)
                    leftMax = leftHeight;
                else
                    water += leftMax - leftHeight;
                left++;

            } else {
                
                if(rightHeight > rightMax)
                    rightMax = rightHeight;
                else
                    water += rightMax - rightHeight;
                right--;
            }
        }

        return water;
    }
	
	```
