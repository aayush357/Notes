## Problem: 
 You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `i`<sup>th</sup>`` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

**Example 1:**

	Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
	Output: 1
	Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)

**Example 2:**

	Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
	Output: 3
	Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

**Example 3:**

	Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
	Output: 4
	Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 10`<sup>4</sup>

## Notes: 
- Background - basic two sum problem where condition is to find pairs sum equal or less than limit
- To find min number of boats we should pair heaviest person with the lightest person 
- if we pair to light person than it will waste the space
- if heavy person cannot share the boat we give him a separate boat as person cannot be more heavy than limit


## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int n = people.length;
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        int boatCount = 0;

        while(left <= right ){
            int currentWeight = people[left] + people[right];

            if(currentWeight <= limit){
                left++;
                right--;
            }
            else
                right--;

            boatCount++;
        }
        return boatCount;
    }
	
	```
