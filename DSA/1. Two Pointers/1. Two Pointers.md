# Two pointers Algorithm
The two pointers algorithm is a technique used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use two pointers, one at the beginning of the array or list and one at the end, and to move them towards each other based on some condition (*Identifying this condition is most important part of two pointers*)
## Identifying
Ways to Identify `Two Pointers` Problem :-
1. Problem has array (or Linked List) and we have to find set of elements that fulfill certain constrains (Array may or may not be sorted) 
3. The set of element is a pair, triplet or sub-array
## Example
```java
int low = 0;
int high = nums.length - 1;

while (low < high) {
	int sum = nums[low] + nums[high];
	
	if (sum == target) {
	    System.out.printf("Pair found (%d, %d)", nums[low], nums[high]);
	    return;
	}
	
	else if (sum < target) {
	    low++;
	}
	
	else {
	    high--;
	}
}
```
