## Problem: 
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return _an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order_.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
	Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
	Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
	After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
	Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `-10`<sup>4</sup>` <= nums[i] <= 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?

## Notes: 
- If we are considering the absolute value ( array can contain +ve and -ve numbers) than largest value can be found either at first index or at last index 
- Keeping this in mind we start filling the res array in reverse order (largest first in last index)
- we keep pointer at ends and compare which one is largest absolute number
- add that to Kth index and decrement k, also move the pointer at which the number was found

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
		int n = nums.length;
		int[] res = new int[n];
		int k = n - 1;
		
		int left = 0;
		int right = n - 1;
		while(left <= right){
			if(Math.abs(nums[left])>Math.abs(nums[right])){
				res[k--] = nums[left] * nums[left];
				left++;
			}
		
			else{
				res[k--] = nums[right] * nums[right];
				right--;
			}
		}
		
		return res;
		}
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N) not considering the sorting  
	- Space: O(1)
