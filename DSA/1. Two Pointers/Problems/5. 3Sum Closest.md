## Problem: 
 Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
	Output: 2
	Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
	Output: 0
	Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10`<sup>4</sup>` <= target <= 10`<sup>4</sup>

## Notes: 
- Same as 3Sum 

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int closest = 0;
        int difference = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int n = nums.length;
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){

            int left = i+1;
            int right = n-1;
            while(left<right){
                int currentSum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
				int currentDiff = Math.abs(currentSum - target);
				
                if(currentDiff < difference){
	                difference = currentDiff;
                    closest = currentSum;
                }

                if(currentSum < target) left++;
                else right--;
            }    
        }
        return closest;
    }
	
	```
