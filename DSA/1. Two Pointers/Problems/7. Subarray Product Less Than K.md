## Problem: 
 Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than_ `k`.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
	Output: 8
	Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
	[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
	Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
	Output: 0

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= k <= 10`<sup>6</sup>

## Notes: 
- Similar to basic sliding window based on condition where product of window is less than K
- Important to note why we are considering count`count += right - left + 1;`

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: Will work for positive numbers array
	```java
	
	public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Product of positive numbers cannot be less than zero
        if (k == 0) return 0;
        
        int prod = 1, count = 0, left = 0, n = nums.length;
        for(int right = 0; right < n; right++){
            prod *= nums[right];

            while(prod>=k && left<=right){
                prod /= nums[left];
                left++; 
            }
	        // Example [i,j] is our window
	        // total subarray possible is 3
	        // [i], [j], [i,j]
	        // now consider we added new element K 
	        // now total subarray possible is 6
	        // [i], [j], [k], [i,j], [j,k], [i,j,k]
	        // But we have already counted some of them
	        // [i,j,k], [j,k], [k] are the new ones
	        // So, Number of subarray in which rightmost 
	        // is present is equal to window size
            count += right - left + 1;
        }

        return count;

    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N)
	- Space: O(1)
- Solution 2: for both Positive and Negative numbers #TODO
