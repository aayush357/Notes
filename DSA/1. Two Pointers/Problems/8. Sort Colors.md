## Problem: 
 Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

	Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
	Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Example 2:**

	Input: nums = [2,0,1]
	Output: [0,1,2]

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	// We maintain two pointers 
    // marking the end of zero 
    // and second to mark start of 2
    
    // [0 to left-1] are 0s
    // [left to i-1] are 1s
    // [i to right-1] are unknown
    // [right to n-1] are 2s
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length, left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int mid = 0;
        while(mid <= right){
            int curr = nums[mid];

            if(curr==0){
                swap(nums, mid, left);
                left++;
                mid++;// As position is processed because
                // Either 
                // left, mid are equal (ie Currentely there are no 1s)
                // Then we simply increment both

                // Or else number at left will be one
                // I this case as well we skip the one (i++)

                // also if we dont move then 
                // we will be stuck (mid will always be 0)
            }
            else if (curr==2){
                swap(nums, mid, right);
                right--;
                // Here we cannot increment i 
                // as after swapping, we can have any 0,1,2
                // So we will need to process it
            } else 
                mid++;
        }
