## Problem: 
 There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengers`<sub>i</sub>`, from`<sub>i</sub>`, to`<sub>i</sub>`]` indicates that the `i`<sup>th</sup> trip has `numPassengers`<sub>i</sub> passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `from`<sub>i</sub> and `to`<sub>i</sub> respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` _if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

	Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
	Output: false

**Example 2:**

	Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
	Output: true

## Notes: 
- Same as Meeting root 2 problem but here we store entire array with start end and passengers. we also check each time whether passengers crossed allowed capacity

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        Arrays.sort(trips, Comparator.comparingInt(t->t[1]));

        PriorityQueue<int[]> inprogress 
            = new PriorityQueue<>
            (Comparator.comparingInt(t->t[2]));
            
        int currentCapacity = 0;
        for(int[] trip : trips){

            // Remove all the trips that will end before current trip atart
            while(!inprogress.isEmpty() && inprogress.peek()[2] <= trip[1]){
                currentCapacity -= inprogress.peek()[0];
                minEnd.poll();
            }

			// Start current trip
            currentCapacity += trip[0];
            inprogress.offer(trip);
            
            if(currentCapacity > capacity)
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
	
	```

	- Time: O(NlogN)
