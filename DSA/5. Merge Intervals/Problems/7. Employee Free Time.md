## Problem: 
 We are given a list `schedule` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping `Intervals`, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

The `Intervals` is an 1d-array. Each two numbers shows an interval. For example, `[1,2,8,10]` represents that the employee works in `[1,2]` and `[8,10]`.

Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

1.schedule and schedule[i] are lists with lengths in range [1, 100].  
2.0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8.

Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input：schedule = [[1,2,5,6],[1,3],[4,10]]
Output：[(3,4)]
Explanation:
There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input：schedule = [[1,3,6,7],[2,4],[2,5,9,12]]
Output：[(5,6),(7,9)]
Explanation：
There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [5, 6], [7, 9],[12,inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	public List<Interval> employeeFreeTime(int[][] schedule) {
	    List<Interval> intervals = createInterval(schedule);    

		// Merge intervals so that we get 
		// continous interval in which employees work
	    intervals = mergeIntervals(intervals);

		// Find interval that is not present in merged interval
        List<Interval> freeTime = new ArrayList<>();
        Interval prev = intervals.get(0);
        for(Interval interval : intervals){
            if(interval.start - prev.end > 0){
                freeTime.add(new Interval(prev.end, interval.start));
            }
            prev = interval;
        }
        
        return freeTime;
    }

	public List<Interval> createInterval(int[][] schedule){
		List<Interval> intervals = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int[] hours : schedule){
            for(int i = 0; i<hours.length-1; i+=2){
                intervals.add(new Interval(hours[i], hours[i+1]));
            }
        }
        return intervals;
	}

	public List<Interval> mergeInterval(List<Interval> intervals){
		Collections.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(i->i.start));
        
        LinkedList<Interval> merged = new LinkedList<>();
        merged.add(intervals.get(0));

        for(Interval interval : intervals){
            Interval prev = merged.getLast();
            if(prev.end >= interval.start){
                prev.end = Math.max(prev.end,interval.end);
            } else {
                merged.add(interval);
            }
        }
	    return merged;
	}
