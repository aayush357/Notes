## Problem: 
 Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start`<sub>i</sub>`, end`<sub>i</sub>`]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

	Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
	Output: 1
	Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

	Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Notes: 
- We want to remove *min* number of intervals to make them not overlapping, So when there is a overlapping intervals we have to keep the one which has lower chance of overlapping with other intervals. 
- Consider example (1, 4), (2, 10). Which one has lower chance of overlapping with the remaining elements if the array is sorted based on start time? One that ends earliest because it is possible that an interval does not overlap with earliest end interval but does with bigger end interval ex (5,11) but vice-versa is not possible 
- So we can sort our intervals based on start time and then keep the lowest end time interval if there is an overlap 
- We can also sort by end then we can just ignore the interval that overlaps with prev interval  (This solution works same as above here we are automatically keeping the interval that ends earliest and ignoring the interval that comes after it)

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: Sorting by start time 
	```java
	
	public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
		//Sort by start
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b)->a[0]-b[0]);

        int count = 0;
        int[] prev = intervals[0];
        for(int i = 1; i<intervals.length; i++){

            int[] interval = intervals[i];
            if(isOverlapping(prev, interval)){
                count++;

				// If overlapping keep min end Interval
                if(prev[1] > interval[1]) prev = interval;
                
            } else {
	            prev = interval;
            }
            
        }
        return count;
    }

    public boolean isOverlapping(int[] a, int[] b){
        return Math.min(a[1], b[1]) - Math.max(a[0], b[0]) > 0;
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(NlogN)
	- Space: O(1)

 - Solution 2: Sorting by end time
	```java
	
	public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
		//Sort by End
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b)->a[1]-b[1]);

        int count = 0;
        int[] prev = intervals[0];
        for(int i = 1; i<intervals.length; i++){

            int[] interval = intervals[i];
            if(isOverlapping(prev, interval)){
                count++;  
            } else {
	            prev = interval;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public boolean isOverlapping(int[] a, int[] b){
        return Math.min(a[1], b[1]) - Math.max(a[0], b[0]) > 0;
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(NlogN)
	- Space: O(1)

**Printing the Array after removing the elements:**

```java
	
	public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
		//Sort by start
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b)->a[0]-b[0]);

        int count = 0;
        int[] prev = intervals[0];
        for(int i = 1; i<intervals.length; i++){

            int[] interval = intervals[i];
            if(isOverlapping(prev, interval)){
				// If overlapping keep min end Interval
                if(prev[1] > interval[1]) prev = interval;
                
            } else {
	            prev = interval;
            }
            
        }
        list.add(prev);
        return list.toArray(new int[0][]);
    }

	public int[][] eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
		//Sort by End
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b)->a[1]-b[1]);
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();

        int count = 0;
        int[] prev = intervals[0];
        for(int i = 1; i<intervals.length; i++){

            int[] interval = intervals[i];

			// Not Overlapping then add to list
            if(!isOverlapping(prev, interval)){

		        list.add(prev);
	            prev = interval;
            }
        }
        list.add(prev);
        return list.toArray(new int[0][]);
    }
```
