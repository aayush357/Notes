## Problem: 
 Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei)`, find the minimum number of conference rooms required.) 
 
 *(0,8),(8,10) is not conflict at 8*

Example

**Example1**

```
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: 2
Explanation:
We need two meeting rooms
room1: (0,30)
room2: (5,10),(15,20)
```

**Example2**

```
Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only need one meeting room
```

## Notes: 
- Use of priority queue to store details of the process that is in-progress (link here we store end time of meetings)

**PriorityQueue + Sorting**
- We sort intervals so that we have meetings in order of their start time
- We maintain endtime of each rooms in the priority queue. (O(1) to fetch min time and O(logN) to add time)
- While iterating through the intervals we need to check whether any meeting is ending before start of current meeting 
- We do it by checking if the meeting ending earliest (endtime.peek) is before start of current, If yes then we use its room, we remove earliest time and update current endtime in the queue. 
- Then the answer will be the size of queue after iterating through intervals
- This will give optimal rooms as we are allocating meeting that is starting earliest to the room that will become empty earliest 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	    public int minMeetingRooms(List<Interval> intervals) {
        if(intervals==null || intervals.size()==0) return 0;

        int len = intervals.size();
        Collections.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(in -> in.start));

		// We store endTime of the meeting that are going on 
		// We required heap because we want to
		// Remove the meeting that end earliest first
        PriorityQueue<Integer> endtime = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for(int i = 0; i<len; i++){
            Interval currentInterval = intervals.get(i);

            // endtime peek will give time of meeting ending earliest
            // If current interval starts after endtime of earliest meeting 
            // then we can use this room and remove this endtime
            // Else there is no available room (as other rooms are booked for longer time)
            // So, Remove all meeting that end before currentInterval.start
            while(!endtime.isEmpty() && endtime.peek() <= currentInterval.start){
                endtime.poll();
            }

            endtime.offer(currentInterval.end);
        }
        return endtime.size();
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(NlogN) = NlogN (sorting) + N (loop) * logN (heap operations)
	- Space: O(N)


**Two Pointers + Sorting**
- Create two separate array for starting and ending times and sort them
- Use two pointers one will iterate start and other will iterate end
- Consider the min time pointer 
- if the pointer is start pointer add room (i.e. new meeting has started)
- if the pointer is end pointer free a room 
- Maintain max count

Solution 2:
```java
	public int minMeetingRooms(List<Interval> intervals) {
        if(intervals==null || intervals.size()==0) return 0;

        int len = intervals.size();
        int[] start = new int[len];
        int[] end = new int[len];

        int i = 0;
        for(Interval interval : intervals){
            start[i] = interval.start;
            end[i] = interval.end;
            i++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(start);
        Arrays.sort(end);
        
        int minReqRooms = 0;
        int currentRooms = 0;
        int startpointer = 0, endpointer = 0;

        while(startpointer < len && endpointer < len){

            if(start[startpointer] < end[endpointer]){
                currentRooms++;
                startpointer++;
            } else {
                currentRooms--;
                endpointer++;
            }

            minReqRooms = Math.max(minReqRooms, currentRooms);
        }
        return minReqRooms;
    }
```
