## Problem: 
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`_'s in the array if you can flip at most_ `k` `0`'s.

**Example 1:**
*Input*: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
*Output*: 6
*Explanation*: [1,1,1,0,0,**1**,1,1,1,1,**1**]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**
*Input*: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
*Output*: 10
*Explanation*: [0,0,1,1,**1**,**1**,1,1,1,**1**,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Constraints:**
-   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
-   `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
-   `0 <= k <= nums.length`

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

## Notes: 
- Same as [[6. Longest repeating character replacement]], Here we don't even need hashmap as we only need to store count of zero. 
- Expand window until we have more than K zeros in the window, then we shrink window until zeroCount is again less than k

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int max = 0, zeroCount = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for(int end = 0; end<nums.length; end++){
            if(nums[end]==0) zeroCount++;

            while(zeroCount>k){
                if(nums[start]==0) zeroCount--;
                start++;
            }

            max = Math.max(max, (end-start+1));
        }

        return max;
    }
	```
