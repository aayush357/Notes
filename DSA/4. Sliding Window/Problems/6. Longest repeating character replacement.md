## Problem: 
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

**Example 1:**

	Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

**Example 2:**

	Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
	The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 105`
-   `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
-   `0 <= k <= s.length`

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

## Notes: 
- We have to count the frequency of the character  and also maintain `mostFreqChar` count in  the window  also check that `windowSize-mostFreqChar <= K`, if not then shrink/slide the window and decrease the frequency of the `windowStart` element also move the `windowStart` pointer
- here we don't need to shrink the window as we want max window size as result 

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int windowStart = 0, mostFreqChar = 0, maxLen = 0;
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for(int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd<s.length(); windowEnd++){
            mostFreqChar = Math.max(mostFreqChar, ++count[s.charAt(windowEnd) - 'A']);

            if((windowEnd - windowStart + 1)-maxRepeat>k){
                --count[s.charAt(windowStart) - 'A'];
                windowStart++;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N)
	- Space: O(26) = O(1) constant space
