## Problem: 
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` _if_ `s2` _contains a permutation of_ `s1`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.
In other words, return `true` if one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.

**Example 1:**

	Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
	Output: true
	Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

**Example 2:**

	Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
	Output: false

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104`
-   `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Notes: 
- This problem is combination of sliding window and anagram. We have to keep sliding the window and match the frequency of the string1 and window of string2 (Problem that I faced was thinking that matching is linear operation hence this is O(N^2) solution) 
- We can make slight optimization by making sure we start with window of size length of string1. 

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	//Sliding window + anagram problem
    //we have to match the Frequency of the s1 and window of s2
    public boolean checkInclusion(String s1, String s2) {
        int len1 = s1.length();
        int len2 = s2.length();

        int[] s1Freq = new int[26];
        int[] windowFreq = new int[26];
        int windowStart = 0;

		//Count the freq of s1
        for(int i=0; i<len1; i++){
            s1Freq[s1.charAt(i)-'a']++;
        }

		//Count freq of the window of s2 and match with freq of s1
        for(int windowEnd=0; windowEnd<len2; windowEnd++){
            windowFreq[s2.charAt(windowEnd)-'a']++;

            if(windowEnd-windowStart+1 > len1){
                windowFreq[s2.charAt(windowStart)-'a']--;
                windowStart++;
            }

			//we can say constant time as array size is always 26
            if(Arrays.equals(s1Freq, windowFreq)){
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
        
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O((N+N) * 26) = O(52N) = O(N)
	- Space: O(26+26) = O(1)
