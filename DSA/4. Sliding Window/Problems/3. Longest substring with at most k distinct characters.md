## Problem: 
Given a string _S_, find the length of the longest substring _T_ that contains at most k distinct characters.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: S = "eceba" and k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: T = "eceb"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: S = "WORLD" and k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: T = "WORL" or "ORLD"
```

Challenge: O(n) time

## Notes: 
- We will keep on adding elements until distinct elements is less than or equal to k, when window has more than K distinct element we remove until it is again less than or equal to K(or just remove start element both ways work as we are finding longest)
- While doing this we have to also check for longest length (when is the question? after adding or after removing)

## Solutions: 
- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
		int windowStart = 0, currLen = 0, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int maxStart = 0;

        for(int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length(); windowEnd++){
            add(map, s.charAt(windowEnd));

			// we can use if as well as we want to find longest
            while(map.size() > k){
                remove(map, s.charAt(windowStart++));
            }

            currLen = windowEnd - windowStart + 1;
            if(max < currLen){
                max = currLen;
                maxStart = windowStart;
            }
        }

        printMax(s, maxStart, max);
        return (max==Integer.MIN_VALUE)? 0 : max;
	}

	// Here we are incrementing the frequency of character
	// Intializing with one if not present
	public void add(Map<Character, Integer> map, Character ch){
		int currentCount = map.getOrDefault(ch, 0);
		map.put(ch, ++currentCount);
	}

	//Here we are decrementing the frequency of character
	//And removing it if the count is <= Zero
	public void remove(Map<Character, Integer> map, Character ch){
		int currentCount = map.get(ch);
		map.put(ch, --currentCount);
		
		if(map.get(ch)<=0) 
			map.remove(ch);
	}
	
	public void printMax(String s, int start, int length){
		length = (length==Integer.MIN_VALUE)? 0 : length;
		System.out.println(s.substring(start,start+length));
	}
	
	```

	- Time: O(N ) at most two traversal of String( once by each left, right pointer)
	- Space: O(K)
