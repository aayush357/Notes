The sliding window algorithm is a technique used to perform a particular task on a list or array. The task is to continuously slide a window of fixed length over the list/array and perform a specific operation on each window, 
- Usually Question will give an array or string and ask 
	1. To find some sub-array or substring of size K with some condition
	2. Longest or smallest sub-array or substring with some condition


## Basic template 
```java
int left = 0;

for(int right=0; right < arr.length; right++) {
// while(right < length) also possible with right++ in the end of loop

	taking element at right into window

	// while is used to shrink
	// if is used to slide
	while or if ( condition related to window size){
		some operation
		moving left pointer;
	}
}

```

#### Types
1. Fixed size window k
	- operations are done inside inner if or while before moving the left pointer as shown above (so that first window grows to size K then operations start)
2. Variable size window 
	- Operations can be done outside of inner if or while 

Notes:

- Sometime sliding window (usually var size ) only work for array with positive numbers and fails for negative numbers this happens when our algorithm assumes our function (ie window sum, product etc) with increase with increase in window size but this might not be true when negative number are part of array
- Sometimes we need to increment more than 1 at a time (say 5), then we can enclose our algorithm inside a for loop from 0 to 5, so that we cover all substring/subarray starting from 0..5 see [[11. Substring with Concatenation of All Words]]
- Sometimes we might not have condition to shrink the window then we can add additional condition on window (based on which we can shrink our window) such that combined result of all such window gives us the result see [[Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters]]
