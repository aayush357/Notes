## Problem: 
 There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the ID of the person sitting in the `i`<sup>th</sup>`` seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2n - 2, 2n - 1)`.

Return _the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side_. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

**Example 1:**

	Input: row = [0,2,1,3]
	Output: 1
	Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.

**Example 2:**

	Input: row = [3,2,0,1]
	Output: 0
	Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.

**Constraints:**

- `2n == row.length`
- `2 <= n <= 30`
- `n` is even.
- `0 <= row[i] < 2n`
- All the elements of `row` are **unique**.

## Notes: 
- Similar to the idea of cyclic sort 
- Here we iterate through even indexes i.e. first number of the pair
- Determine the correct second number for current pair
	- Current number say `i` is even then second no. will be `i+1`
	- else it will be `i-1`
- Now if the second number of current pair is not the expected number then we need make it correct by swapping else if it is correct move to next pair
- Here we have maintained pos\[\] which will help us to determine the position of the expected number using which we can easily swap the second number with correct number

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int minSwapsCouples(int[] row) {
        int n = row.length;

        // Used to find index of correct 2nd 
        // number of the pair
        int[] pos = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            pos[row[i]] = i;
        }


        // Iterate through the even indexes 
        // check if odd index is correct 
        // if not then swap with correct and count 
        int i = 0, count = 0;
        while(i < n-1){
            int expected = correct2nd(row[i]);
            if(row[i+1]!=expected){
                swap(row, pos, i+1, pos[expected]);
                count++;
            } else {
                i+=2;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    // If 1st number is even then 2nd will be 1st + 1
    // else it will be 1st - 1
    public int correct2nd(int i){
        return (i%2==0)? i+1 : i-1;
    }

    // Swap items in row array and update pos array as well
    public void swap(int[] row, int[] pos, int i, int j){
        int temp = row[i];
        row[i] = row[j];
        row[j] = temp;

        pos[row[i]] = i;
        pos[row[j]] = j;
    }
	
	```
