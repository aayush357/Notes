## Problem: 
 Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

Example 1:

	Input: nums = [3,0,1]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

	Input: nums = [0,1]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

	Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
	Output: 8
	Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Notes: 
- We can easily sort this array in O(N) time as numbers are given in range (0, n). After which the index of the first number that is not at correct place is the answer.
- For example`[8,6,4,2,3,9,7,0,1]` will become `[0,1,2,3,4,` <u>9</u> `,6,7,8]` after sorting. Note here 9 is not at correct place hence the correct number `5` is missing

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        sort(nums, n);

        // First Number not at correct index
        for(int i =0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i]!=i)
                return i;
        }

        return nums.length;
    }

	// Cyclic sort
    public void sort(int[] nums, int n){
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n){
            int index = nums[i];
            if(index<n && nums[index] != nums[i]){
                swap(nums, i, index);
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

    public void swap(int[] a, int i, int j){
        int temp = a[i];
        a[i] = a[j];
        a[j] = temp;
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N)
	- Space: O(1)
