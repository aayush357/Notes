# 6. Cyclic Sort

The **pigeonhole principle** states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

Cyclic sort is used to sort an array in *O(N)* time complexity and *O(1)* space complexity. This array can have numbers in a *given range like [1, n]*

- In Cyclic sort we iterate through the array checking if the current number is at correct position if not then we swap it with its correct index, Else we move to next number.

**Code:**
```java
public void cyclicSort(int[] nums){
	int n = nums.length, i = 0;

	while(i < n){
		int correctIdx = nums[i] - 1;

		if(nums[correctIdx] != nums[i])
			swap(nums, i, correctIdx);
		else
			i++;
	}
}
```

- Time Complexity: O(N-1) + O(N) = O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

**Identification:** 
- Problem involving sorted array with numbers in *given range*
- Find *Missing/Duplicate/Smallest* Number in *Sorted/Rotated Array*

	Ideal case for array will be \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... n\] , But in given array some elements will not be present in their place some other number will be there (like duplicate of remaining number), Also given array will be unsorted

Notice In above problems we are placing the items to their correct place using the index of array. But it is important to understand that cyclic sort pattern is not only limited to use of index to find the correct location of the item.

- Essentially we need to find a way to determine what will be the correct item for current position or what is the correct position for current item
- If we don't have that condition then we swap these two positions
