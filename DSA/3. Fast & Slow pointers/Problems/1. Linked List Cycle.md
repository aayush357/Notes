## Problem: 
 Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. ReturnÂ `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

[Link]( https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Notes: 
- Can be done using HashSet to store each node and if we come across any node that appears twice we return true. But this we be in O(N)
- We can use fast and slow pointer to detect the cycle. We will loop until list ends (if there is a cycle it will never end) using fast and slow pointers if they both meet it means cycle exists
- **Proof :** if both fast and slow pointers are in a cycle and there is some `n` nodes between them, then after each iteration this number will decrease by 1 as fast is moving 2 steps while slow is only moving by 1.

## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
	public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head, slow = head;
        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if(slow == fast) {                
	            return true;
	            // ==TO FIND LEN OF CYCLE==

	            // int len = 1;
		        // slow = slow.next;
	            // while(fast!=slow){
		        //    slow = slow.next;
		        //    len++;
	            // }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
	
	```
	Complexity: 
	- Time: O(N) 
		1. Either there is no loop and fast pointer reaches the end of linked list in N steps
		2. Or there is a loop, then it will take N - M steps to reach the start of loop (M is length of cycle) and It will take M steps for them to meet (As after each step distance between pointers is decreased by 1 and the max distance can be M (length of loop)) 
		3. So Either O(N) or O(N + N - M) => O(N)
	- Space: O(1)
