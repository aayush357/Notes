## Problem: 
 Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

## Notes: 
- Here we detect the cycle using the same approach as in [[1. Linked List Cycle]] and then,
- ![[Pasted image 20230309194246.png]]
- We can prove that (A + B) = nC (where n is number of cycles fast pointer has done) [More details (GFG)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/floyds-cycle-finding-algorithm/)
- The distance highlighted in blue is equal to the distance from head to start of cycle (A)
- So now we can easily find the cycle start
	- We will place start pointer on head and slow pointer will remain at meeting point
	- then we move both one step until they both meet
	- the node at which they both meet is the start of the cycle (As both pointer will cover equal distance `a`)
## Solutions: 

- Solution 1: 
	```java
	
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head, start = head;

        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if(slow == fast)
                break;
        }

        if(fast==null || fast.next==null)
            return null;
        
        while(start!=slow) {
            start = start.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return start;
    }
	
	```
