**Fast and slow pointer** pattern is a type of two pointers algorithm where fast pointer moves 2 steps and slow pointer moves one steps. This pattern is useful in questions involving Linked List and Arrays

**Popular Questions:**
- Detecting cycle in a Linked List
- Find middle of linked list
- Removing duplicate from array containing elements in range \[1,n\] 
- Palindrome detection in Linked List

**Notes:**

Note the difference between conditions
- `while (fast != null && fast.next != null)`  and  
- `while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null)`
When we want to find the middle of LinkedList using first condition using first condition we get `B` as middle Node. Whereas with second condition we get a
